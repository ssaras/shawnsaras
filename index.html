                    Hey! I'm Shawn, a professional Software Engineer with over a decade of industry experience
                    developing everything from landing pages, to enterprise software. I started writing 
                    code years ago as a side gig, converting PSDs to HTML/CSS during the days when HTML 
                    tables were the standard for laying out web pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During that time, some would request additional functionality, and so I learned JavaScript. Others would ask If 
                    I could handle the hosting, and so I learned about Linux servers, DNS records, PHP and MySQL.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    Shortly after, I would land my first full-time job as a Front-End Developer, 
                    building the UI for an enterprise e-commerce application using HTML, CSS and jQuery/AJAX. 
                    Our back-end was written in Java, but the only back-end developer left the company. Having built 
                    a few games in Java as personal, fun projects, I told my boss, "I know Java", 
                    and thus also, began my journey as a Full-Stack Software Engineer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would later join another company building enterprise software in C#, including an application
                    that could import .cad files containing 2D cross sections and generate full, interactive 3D models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then, I've have built and deployed many C#, PHP and Java applications 
                    to Linux, and Microsoft servers, running in AWS, Azure and others.
