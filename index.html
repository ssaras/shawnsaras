                    Hey! I'm Shawn, a professional <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with over a decade of industry experience
                    developing everything from <strong>landing pages</strong>, to <strong>enterprise software</strong>. I started writing 
                    code years ago as a side gig, converting PSDs to <strong>HTML/CSS</strong> during the days when <strong>HTML</strong> 
                    tables were the standard for laying out web pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During that time, some would request additional functionality, and so I learned <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Others would ask If 
                    I could handle the hosting, and so I learned about <strong>Linux servers</strong>, <strong>DNS records</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    Shortly after, I would land my first full-time job as a <strong>Front-End Developer</strong>, 
                    building the UI for an enterprise e-commerce application using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>jQuery/AJAX</strong>. 
                    Our back-end was written in <strong>Java</strong>, but the only back-end developer left the company. Having built 
                    a few games in <strong>Java</strong> as personal, fun projects, I told my boss, <i>"I know Java"</i>, 
                    and thus also, learned <strong>back-end development</strong>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would later join another company as a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> building enterprise software in <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>ASP.Net</strong> and <strong>SQL Server</strong>, including an application
                    that could import .cad files containing 2D cross sections, and generate full, interactive 3D models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then, I've have built and deployed many <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>ASP.Net</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>Java</strong> applications 
                    to <strong>Linux servers</strong>, and <strong>Microsoft servers</strong>, running in <strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>Azure</strong> and others,
                    using <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>SQL Server</strong> databases and <strong>MVC Framework</strong>.
